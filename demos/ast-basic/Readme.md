# Code to AST

This is a basic example that demonstrates how to convert code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure and visualize it in different ways. In this directory, you will find two examples: one that runs in the console and another that provides a more visual experience in the browser.

## Console Example

To see a JSON representation of the AST output in the console, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the "Code to AST" directory.

2. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm run start:console:basic1
   ```

You should now see the JSON output representing the AST structure of the provided code sample.

## Browser Example

To interact with a live demo that allows you to input JavaScript code and see the resulting AST structure in JSON format, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the "Code to AST" directory.

2. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```
   npm run start:browser:basic1
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

Now, you can write JavaScript code in the provided editor and see the corresponding AST structure update in real-time as you make changes to the code.
