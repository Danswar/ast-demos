## Introduction

Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) are tree-like representations of source code that are widely used in various programming languages. They play a vital role in understanding and transforming code. Tools like Webpack and Babel rely on ASTs to perform code optimizations, transpilation, and bundling.

In this repository, you will find various demos that illustrate how to leverage ASTs in conjunction with Webpack and Babel, as well as explore their potential uses and applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AST Demos, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AST-Demos.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd AST-Demos
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Choose a demo from the list below and navigate to its respective directory.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file of the selected demo.

## Demos

The following demos are included in this repository:

1. [**AST Basics**](./demos/ast-basics): A simple introduction to ASTs, exploring their structure and basic operations.
2. [**Babel AST**](./demos/babel-ast): Discover the power of ASTs in Babel transpilation, including the creation of custom plugins and transformations.
3. [**Code Analysis**](./demos/code-analysis): Use ASTs to analyze and extract valuable information from your codebase.
